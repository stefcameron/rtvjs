# RTV.js

Runtime Verification Library for browsers and Node.js.

This library is isomorphic: It runs equally well in modern browsers and on the server with Node.js.

# Goals

Shapes must be:

*   serializable to JSON so they remain portable;
*   composable (shapes can reference other shapes);
*   easy to express (rich types and qualifiers);
*   easy to customize (with validators).
